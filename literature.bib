abstract = {Introduction A Version Control System (VCS), also known as a Revision Control System or Source Control System, is required when developing projects above a few hundred lines of code or where more than one developer needs to collaborate on a project. It is therefore used extensively on most software projects. We start this article with a brief introduction to version control, then consider its trajectory from its early days to the current state of the art, and finally conclude with a brief discussion of what the future might hold for software versioning. Along the way, we shall discuss versioning taxonomy, compare a VCS with the broader configuration management capability, and consider the incredible impact that open source software has had in the development of VCS technology.},
