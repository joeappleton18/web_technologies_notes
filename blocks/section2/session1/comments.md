#Comments 
In javascript there are two ways to create comments 

**Block Comments**

```javascript
	/* This is a block comment, we can run 
		over multiple lines 
	*/
```
**Inline Comments**

```javascript
	// This is a inline comment, it can only take up one line
```


* Add comments for the purpose of making the source code easier to understand* Comments are not displayed in the browsers* It is also a good practice to "hide" scripts from browsers without support for it
