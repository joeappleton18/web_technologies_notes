 - In order better understand the idea of content rights. It is useful to consider how content came to be on the world wide web to begin with

- What's interesting is the origins of the world wide web can be traced back to a single individual Tim Berners-Lee

- In the mid 80's to early 90's Tim Beners-Lee was working at CERN, home of the particle accelerator the Large Hadron Collider 
- CERN is a huge collaborative international research project consisting of a steady stream of researchers coming and going at any given time 
- Often when a group of scientist left often much of their unpublished work was undiscoverable 
- In 1989 Beners-Lee proposed a hypertext system that would sit on top of the internet ({{"Berners1989" | citeNoBraces}}). His idea was to define a set technologies to allow computers running on different operating systems to communicate in a decent fashion. The system consisted of of the following primary technologies:


  - A Universal Resource Locator (URL) to identify resources
  - Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) to represent HTML documents 
  - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
  - [A Hyper Text server implementing HTTP](https://www.w3.org/Daemon/)


-  [In 1993 the development the first Mosaic](https://github.com/alandipert/ncsa-mosaic) the first graphical web browser popularised the Word Wide Web

- [In 1994  Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which maintains web standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/)
