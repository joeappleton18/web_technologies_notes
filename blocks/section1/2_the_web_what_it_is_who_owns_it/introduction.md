# What is the web and who owns information



- From a theoretical perspective, this block promises to be interesting. We are going to be looking at who owns resources on the world wide web and how we can legally use them in our own projects

- To understand digital rights we'll be exploring how information actually exists on the internet. From a legal perspective,  I'll briefly be looking at how content can be freely licensed and the idea behind creative commons

- Practically, this block will look at cascading style sheets and how they are used to control the look and feel of HTML
