# Where Do Websites Live

- On the whole web sites and web applications don't live on your computer
- The reason I say **on the whole** is now using technologies such as electron and 
  react native script use web technologies to create desktop an mobile applications
  However, to begin with we'll focus on the more traditional web architecture 
- There is a concept of `front end` and `back end`
- Pages and resources are fetched via the Hyper(H) Text(T) Transfer(T) Protocol(P) and sent from server to your local computer

```
:authority: www.google.co.uk
:method: GET
:path: /
:scheme: https

```
>> An HTTP request header

## Front End 

- When developers refer to the `front end` of a website the usually mean the `HTML/CSS/JavaScript` used to display the visual elements of a page 

## Back End 

- The `back end` refers to the functionality that lives on the web s server. Common server side languages are `Python`, `PHP` and `RUBY`.
