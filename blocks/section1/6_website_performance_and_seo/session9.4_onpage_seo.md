#On-Page SEO 
On-page SEO is essentially best practices that you should follow when creating HTML pages. Unlike Off-Page SEO, everything is directly under your control, so it's very easy to implement.   


## Page Title

 * Create Unique & Accurate Page Titles
 * `<title>` tag tells users & search engines what the topic of a particular page is

 * **Bad** does not in any way describes the page content
 	
 		<title> Home </title>
 		
 * **Good** Accurately describes the page's content   
		
	    <title> Brandon's Baseball Cards - Buy Cars, Baseball News, Card Prices </title>
* Title contents are displayed in search results

* Create **unique** title tags for each page


## Meta Tags 

* `<meta>` tags contain information about the web page 

* Description: used by search engines to provide a short summary of the page

		<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials"/>



## URL Structure

* Navigation is very important for search engines
* Plan out navigation based on the homepage
* Put an HTML site map up and link to it from the home page

 

## Internal Links

Your internal links should use descriptive anchor text. Anchor text is the text between the two `<a>` tags. 

**bad**
	
	<a href="tutorial.html"> Tutorial </a>  
	
**good**

	<a href="tutorial.html"> Beginners SEO Tutorial </a>  
	
	
##  Content 

Your HTML pages should be well structured and meaningful, consider the following:  

* Each page should have a unique `<h1>` tag
* All content should be well written and easy to follow
* All images should have a descriptive `alt` attribute 
		
		<img alt="Google Search"> google.jpg </img>
