#Off-Page SEO 

As mentioned, off-page SEO is in general about building inbound links to your website. Inbound links are also know as **back links**

##Inbound Links are A Vote

An inbound link is a link from an external website that points to your website.  **Search engines** view a link as a vote of confidence for your website. **A websites ranking**, is often proportional to the amount of inbound links.

**Building** links is thought to have the greatest effect out of any SEO activity, when it comes to climbing the search rankings. However, not all inbound links are considered equal. 

Higher quality inbound links will yield better results. It's thought the following effects link quality:

* The trustworthiness of the linking domain
* The popularity of the linking page
* The relevancy of the content between the source page and the target page
* The anchor text used in the link
* The amount of links to the same page on the source page
* The amount of domains that link to the target page
* The amount of variations that are used as anchor text to links to the target page
* The ownership relationship between the source and target domains
