#Keyword and Competitor Research

##Understanding Key Words 

Keywords are the search terms that we want our website to rank in the search results for. 
The first stage of performing SEO on our website is determining which keywords we want to target.  However, not all keywords are created equal:

A good quality keyword will:

* Have a reasonable search volume
* A low number of competitor sites trying to optimise for the key word

##Case Study - A Southampton Hairdressing Company  
Imagine you're creating a website for a hairdressing firm. Let's consider the typical SEO process that would be undertaken.

##Finding Prospective Keywords
Firstly we need to find a list of prospective keywords that we may want to target. Google is a great place to start, we can simply enter an obvious keyword, such as  "Southampton Hairdressers" and take a note of it's suggested search terms. This can serve as a seed list of keywords.

Next we need to determine the search volume for each of these keywords.  We can use the Google Keyword Tool to achieve this. This tool will also give you further keyword suggestions and a rough idea of how competitive the keyword is: [https://adwords.google.co.uk/KeywordPlanner](https://adwords.google.co.uk/KeywordPlanner)
