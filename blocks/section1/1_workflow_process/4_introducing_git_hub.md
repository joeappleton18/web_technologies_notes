# Git Remote Repositories

- One of the true powers of working with GIT is the ability to distribute your work to a remote GIT server
- There are a couple of reasons why this is useful:
    - It allows for easy collaboration with others programmers 
    - Your work is always backed up 


# The GIT Server

- [While it is possible to set up your own git server.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server) Most people opt for a  preconfigured hosted git server.

- [www.github.com](www.gihub.com) is one of the the most popular remote host and our choice for this unit.

- [GITHub](https://github.com/about) at the time of writing has more than 27 million members who have collectively created 80 million repositories. 
- While GitHub is primarily marketed towards development teams it is nonetheless an excellent tool to use as an individual programmer.
- You can think of it as the ultimate cloud storage for your programming work.
