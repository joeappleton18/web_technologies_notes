# Ethics and Data Collection

- This block looks sand the laws and regulations of publishing on the internet. We will focus on the following legislations:

    - [](The Data Protection Act (GPPR))
    - Electronic Commerce Directive (EC Directive)
    - Web Accessibility and Discrimination Act
    - Consumer Protection and Distance Selling Regulation

- The legalities of a website, while not the most exciting of topic, is probably one of the most important

- When you're publishing a website (especially if you are a business), there could be serious legal implications if you do not abide to the regulations

- You'll need to demonstrate that you've considered web legislation in your assignment
