# Supporting Mobile Devices 

- This block looks at responsive design

- Responsive design web design is an approach that allows the 
website to naturally adapt based on the device you are viewing it on.  <small>[http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)</small>

 
 >> Rather than tailoring disconnected designs to each of an ever-increasing number of web devices, we can treat them as facets of the same experience. We can design for an optimal viewing experience, but embed standards-based technologies into our designs to make them not only more flexible, but more adaptive to the media that renders them. In short, we need to practice responsive web design.
