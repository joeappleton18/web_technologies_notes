# Web Technologies Workflow


- You can think of a workflow as a systematic approach to doing repetitive tasks

- The term 'workflow' has roots in 1920s manufacturing and the need for orchestrating efficient ways to get repetitive tasks done.

- Programmers have adopted this idea of workflow and the term is commonly used. Whilst programming is a highly creative process we can not ignore that there are many repetitive tasks and they should be approached using repeatable organised workflows.

- Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of the high level workflow we'll use on this course. 

	- Work is created locally 
	- Local work is version controlled using GIT 
	- [HTML is validated using the W3C](https://validator.w3.org/ validator)
	- [At the end of each session the work is pushed up to GITHub](https://github.com/)

- I am sure at this stage many of the above terms may well appear somewhat alien and that's ok. I just want you to understand the idea of workflow and that Figure 1 is an abstract representation of the the given workflow for this unit.  In due time the more granular details will become clear.
