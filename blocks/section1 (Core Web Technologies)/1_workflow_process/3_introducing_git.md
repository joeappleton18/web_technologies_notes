- GIT is a widely used free decentralised VCS (DVCS)


-  Its history can be traced back to the origins of the Linux kernel open source project. Between 1991 and 2002 changes in the project were shared between developers by emailing around patches. 

- In 2002 Linus Trovalds the founder of the linux project placed it under version control using the  free DVCS system BitKeeper.

- In 2005 BitKeeper put up a pay wall, the software was no longer free. This prompted Linus Torvalds to create his own DCVS

>> **Interesting Point:** Linus named his VCS GIT as a slight at the former BitKeeper team, specifically Larry McCoy
