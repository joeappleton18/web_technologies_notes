Please read the below carefully, it will provide you with assessment and learning information. 

## Learning Strategy

- [Firstly, as an absolute minimum, you should make sure that you've completed the practical tasks](practical-tasks.md).   Next, you should focus you attention on learning by doing and start [the main assessment](https://learn.solent.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=27733&section=1). 

- For the our next meet up (Tues, 26 June), you should have decided on your project idea. As a group we'll go over these, it will be useful process in honing our plans. 

## Assessment Information

Web technologies has two assessed components:

- A time constrained assessment 
- [A coursework assignment, which you will be working on from now](https://learn.solent.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=27733&section=1)

You should note, while unlikely to change, the hand-in and TCA dates are currently provisional. 


##  Time Constrained Assessment  (18th Sep 2018)

This will be a two hour open book assessment that's worth 50% of the final grade. The interpretation of 'open book' for this unit is as follows:

- You can use any of you own material and notes, including pre written code samples
- You will have full unrestricted access to the internet and the notes 

It will focus on laying out HTML using CSS; it will **not** test you on JavaScript. This test is nothing to worry about, and through the process of completing the larger assignment you'll gleam more than enough knowledge to do well. 

## Assignment 1 (28 Sep 2018)

This assignment, worth 50% of the final mark, will account to the majority of your remaining work on the unit. [Ensure you read the assessment brief carefully](https://learn.solent.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=27733&section=1).
