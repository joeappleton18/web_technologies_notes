Web Technologies CDA404\nWelcome to Web Technologies, delivered by me Joe Appleton! As the name suggests this unit will be introducing you to the technologies used to power web-based applications. \nGlobally the internet has become intertwined in our lives. I see the internet as a platform for delivering sophisticated applications. Furthermore, on a philosophical level, I see software applications as a means to solve problems.  Herein lies is why the internet from a developers perspective is such an exciting prospect. We get to solve problems (write applications) and distribute to the global platform that is the internet.\nTeacher and Teaching Focus\nIn order to gain a better understanding of how to learn on this particular unit, firstly I must briefly introduce myself and my teaching approach. While this unit is all about you the learner,  it is necessary to very briefly introduce my skill-set.\nJoe Appleton\n\n\nLecturer in Programming  for 3 years (web)\nPhD Student at Lancaster University (Research Interest - Technology Enhanced Learning)\n10 years industry experience specialising in programming web applications\nCurrently involved in several technical web projects\nShowcased Programming Skills in Winning A Global Hackathon\n\nMy Teaching Style\nWhen teaching a topic such as web technologies, it's very tempting to overly focus on tools. This is the approach that I indeed took in my early lecturing career. However, what differentiates university from technical training is that as graduates we should not only know the latest tools but also appreciate the ethical and theoretical underpinning of our subject. To that end, I shall be, where possible, attempting to focus on theory in the lectures and tools in the practicals. \nTheory without application is of little use. We will therefore apply the theory in the practicals and assignments. \nWhile I am providing a basic scaffolding for your learning, the style in which I do so may be different from what you're used to in school or college. I believe you construct your own knowledge and learn socially (Bandura, and Walters, 1977). I encourage all of you to interact in person and social media and learn together. My job as a teacher is not directly to provide you with knowledge but rather guide you in finding things out yourself. \nTheories\nThroughout this course you I will be introduced the below theories which are vital to understand when constructing web application:\n\nThe Importance of Workflow \nCreative Commons \nColour Theory  \nGrids and Design Ratios \nEthics, Accessibility and Data Protection \n\nWe will apply the above theories to make websites with the below tool set:\nKey Tools\n\nGitHub & Git Hub  (Version Control)\nHTML 5\nJavaScript \nCSS\n\nReading List\nBlock 1\nTo understand the history of version control\nRochkind, M.

In fact you may well have already implemented your own version control system by keeping multiple versions of your work in different folders (see Figure 2)\n\n\n Figure 2 - A Manual Version Control Workflow \n\nThe above method is very ineffective! Firstly we don't know exactly what has changed in each version. Secondly we may accidentally write to the wrong folder or forget entirely to make a backup\n\n\nVersion Control Systems (VCS) automate the process of controlling versions of your work. The first SCS was proposed developed by Marc Rochkind in 1975 while working at Bell Labs (Rochkind, 1975)\n\n\n Figure 3 - Changes Graph \n\nRockind proposed that rather than keeping full duplicates of the project we should only keep copies of the changes. These changes are linked together in a graph/tree like structure. Firstly, this significantly saves on space (which was a  premium at the time) as we only store our changes and note complete versions of our work. Secondly having the changes in a graph allow easy navigation of the graph allowing us to roll our work back and forward\n\nOne of the first widely used VCS was RCS (insert citation). Developers would check files into the RCS to put them under version control. When a developer wanted to work on a given file that specific file would be individually checked out to work on. Changes are logged in a graph like structure proposed by Rockind.  \n\n\n"},"blocks/section1/1_workflow_process/2.1_distributed_vs_centralised_version_control.html":{"url":"blocks/section1/1_workflow_process/2.1_distributed_vs_centralised_version_control.html","title":"Distributed vs Centralised Version Control","keywords":"","body":"Distributed Vs Centralised Version Control\n\nSo far we've only looked at VCSs that keep a revision history on the developers local computer. Perhaps you've already considered some the glaring issues! \n\nWhat happens if your local computer goes down? \nHow to we collaborated with other developers on the same project?\n\n\n\nCentralised version control\n \n Figure 4 - Centralised Version Control  \n\nThe first proposed solution to the above problem was to place the VCS on a centralised server (see Figure 4). Developers would check out individual files and work on them locally. After making changes they would check the file back into the remote server. While this configuration allows collaboration it still has the major downside that the entire project is kept in a single location. A single location of course means exposure to a single point of failure.  \n\nDistributed version control\n \n Figure 5 - Distributed Version Control  \n\nA distributed version control system such as GIT solves the aforementioned problems. In such systems developers don't just check out single files or the latest snap shot of the project rather they fully mirror the project and all of its revisions. Should the server or any other computer die, then anyone who's working on the project has a full history. \n\n"},"blocks/section1/1_workflow_process/3_introducing_git.html":{"url":"blocks/section1/1_workflow_process/3_introducing_git.html","title":"Introducing GIT","keywords":"","body":"Introduction GIT\n\n\nGIT is a widely used free decentralised VCS (DVCS)\n\n\nIts history can be traced back to the origins of the Linux kernel open source project. Between 1991 and 2002 changes in the project were shared between developers by emailing around patches. \n\nIn 2002 Linus Trovalds the founder of the linux project placed it under version control using the  free DVCS system BitKeeper.\n\nIn 2005 BitKeeper put up a pay wall, the software was no longer free. This prompted Linus Torvalds to create his own DCVS\n\n\n\n\nInteresting Point: Linus named his VCS GIT as a slight at the former BitKeeper team, specifically Larry McCoy\n\n\n"},"blocks/section1/1_workflow_process/3.1_git_vcs_stratergy.html":{"url":"blocks/section1/1_workflow_process/3.1_git_vcs_stratergy.html","title":"GIT VCS Strategy","keywords":"","body":"Version Control Using Git\n\nRecall that early VCSs tracked the changes in files storing them in \na graph like structure. \n\nGIT differs from traditional version control systems in that it stores an  entire copy of files as they change. It's in effect an automation to the manual process of manually duplicating the project and storing it in multiple folders.\n\nAs we have a complete history of our files over time. GIT allows us to make changes without worrying if we break things. We can simply roll back to earlier versions of our work. \n\n\nGIT Workflow\n \n  Figure 6 - A Simple Git Workflow \n\nFigure 6 is a visual representation of a simple git workflow. \n - One or more files are firstly staged for commit \n - Once the commit is ready a snap shot is taken in the form of a `commit` . A programmer defined message is attached to the commit describing the changes\n - That's it! It really is that simple at least to start with. For now just be aware that you can recover historic versions of your work. However, to keep things simple we won't be looking into file recovery until later in the unit. What's key at this point is you become comfortable with the basic GIT workflow. \n\n\n"},"blocks/section1/1_workflow_process/4_introducing_git_hub.html":{"url":"blocks/section1/1_workflow_process/4_introducing_git_hub.html","title":"Introducing GIT HUB","keywords":"","body":"Git Remote Repositories\n\nOne of the true powers of working with GIT is the ability to distribute your work to a remote GIT server\nThere are a couple of reasons why this is useful:\nIt allows for easy collaboration with others programmers \nYour work is always backed up \n\n\n\nThe GIT Server\n\nWhile it is possible to set up your own git server.
