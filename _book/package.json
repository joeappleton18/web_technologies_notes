  "description": "Welcome to Web Technologies, delivered by me Joe Appleton! As the name suggests this unit will be introducing you to the technologies used to power web-based applications.  Globally the internet has become intertwined in our lives, we of course deeply familiar with it. However, as an application developer, I take a different view and after this course, I hope you will too. I see the internet as a platform for delivering sophisticated applications. Furthermore, on a philosophical level, I see software applications as a means to solve problems.  Herein lies is why the internet from a developers perspective is such an exciting prospect.
